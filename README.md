# Fluent Icons
An icon pack for Powercord & BetterDiscord that replaces most icons with Microsoft's Fluent Design Icons. This theme is forked/based on [GoogleMaterialIcons](https://github.com/DavidNyan10/GoogleMaterialIcons).

## Powercord Quick CSS & BetterDiscord Custom CSS
**Powercord:** Go to **Settings > Themes > Quick CSS** and add the following code

**BetterDiscord:** First make sure Custom CSS is enabled by going to **Settings > BetterDiscord Settings > Custom CSS**, Then go to the **Custom CSS** section and add the following code. As of now this is the only way to get the theme working on BetterDiscord.

    @import url("https://stickfab.github.io/pc-fluenticons/FluentIcons.css");
